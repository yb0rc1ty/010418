___
## productView.html
The Product View template contains the html for the Product List, including Product List filters and pagination.
## productBrowse.html
The Product Browse template contains the html for a Category Tree as well as the ui-view that pulls in the Product View.
## mobileCategory.modal.html
On smaller viewports, the Category Tree left nav is hidden, and replaced with a modal.
## card.product.html
Each product is represented within a Product Card. The Product Card template can be found at [common/directives/oc-product-card/oc-product-card.html](../common/directives/oc-product-card/oc-product-card.html).
## Styling
Styling for the Product Browse and Product Card components is located in the following files:

`styles/components/_catalog-card.less`  
`styles/components/_product-browse.less`  
`styles/layout/_catalog-grid.less`  

Flexbox is used on the Product List to set equal heights on the Product Cards. This creates a uniform layout, and will also prevent float issues caused by the lack of a clearing element between rows.
